# Embedding Visualization

## What is it?

Embedding Visualization is the process of taking high-dimensional embedding vectors (like word embeddings or positional embeddings, which can have hundreds or thousands of dimensions) and representing them in a low-dimensional space, typically 2D or 3D, so that they can be plotted and visually inspected by humans.

## Why Visualize Embeddings?

Visualizing embeddings can provide valuable insights into what a model has learned:

1.  **Understanding Semantic Relationships:** Check if tokens (words, subwords) with similar meanings or functions cluster together in the visualization. This suggests the model has captured semantic similarities.
2.  **Discovering Analogies/Patterns:** Explore if geometric relationships exist in the embedding space (e.g., vector('king') - vector('man') + vector('woman') â‰ˆ vector('queen')).
3.  **Debugging and Sanity Checks:** If embeddings form a random cloud or nonsensical clusters, it might indicate issues with training, data, or the model architecture.
4.  **Analyzing Positional Information:** Visualizing positional embeddings might reveal patterns related to sequence order (e.g., adjacent positions being close, periodic patterns).

## Common Techniques

Dimensionality reduction algorithms are used to project the high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space:

1.  **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**

    - A linear technique that finds the principal components (axes of greatest variance) in the data.
    - Projects data onto the top 2 or 3 components.
    - Fast and good at capturing global structure but may miss non-linear relationships.

2.  **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):**

    - A non-linear technique particularly effective at revealing local structure and clusters.
    - Focuses on preserving the neighborhood relationships of points from high-D to low-D.
    - Can be computationally intensive, and distances between separated clusters might not be meaningful.

3.  **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):**
    - Another powerful non-linear technique.
    - Often considered a good balance between capturing local structure (like t-SNE) and preserving global structure (better than t-SNE).
    - Can be faster than t-SNE, especially for larger datasets.

## How is it Done?

Typically, after a model has been trained:

1.  Extract the learned embedding weight matrix (e.g., `model.embedding_layer.weight.data`).
2.  Feed this matrix into a dimensionality reduction tool (like `sklearn.manifold.TSNE` or `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`).
3.  Obtain the 2D or 3D coordinates for each original embedding vector.
4.  Use a plotting library (like `matplotlib` or `seaborn`) to create a scatter plot of these coordinates. Often, points are labeled or colored based on the corresponding token or some metadata.

_(Note: Visualizing embeddings from an *untrained* model will likely just show random scatter, as no meaningful structure has been learned yet.)_
