Let’s make a language model that can raise an eyebrow and say the right thing without sounding like a spam bot. I’d start with a base LLM that’s light enough for weekend hacking but still smart—Meta’s open Llama‑3 8B sits in that sweet spot and already has the chat headroom you need.

TRL’s `PPOTrainer` does the heavy lifting. A vanilla run is literally one CLI line; everything from rollouts to KL‑penalties is baked in the doc quick‑start, so you can swap “dummy reward” for something spicier without rewriting the loop. If you want to peek at the full script, the examples folder keeps a ready‑to‑launch PPO file you can copy straight into `accelerate launch`, GPU or no GPU.  

Now for the secret sauce: a reward that measures flirtiness rather than generic positivity. A sneaky shortcut is the `ieuniversity/flirty_or_not` dataset—3 k lines of human‑tagged messages that scream or mumble flirt vibes. Fine‑tune a tiny RoBERTa on that as a reward model and you’ve got a scalar signal that lights up when the bot gets coy.  

Wire‑up is simple: prompt goes in, model replies, reward head scores the reply, `PPOTrainer` nudges weights to chase that score while clipping the KL so your llama doesn’t forget grammar. Keep an eye on `objective/rlhf_reward` and `policy/approxkl_avg`; when the first drifts up and the second hovers around 0.1‑0.2 you’re cooking—not spamming. The trainer already logs those for you, so TensorBoard will tell you when the charm meter stalls.  

Optional mischief: sprinkle a toxicity detector alongside the flirt scorer and subtract its output from the reward so the model stays smooth, not sleazy. You can even weight those two heads dynamically and watch the policy find the edge of playful.  

Your opening task could be twenty curated prompts like “Text a crush after meeting at a conference” and “Break the ice on Bumble.” Run PPO for a couple of SFT‑initialised epochs and sample every few hundred updates—you’ll hear the tone graduate from bland to cheeky.  

Here’s the minimal flight‑plan without turning it into a checklist. Grab the Llama‑3 8B chat model off the Hub; it’s small enough for a single‑GPU sprint yet already versed in dialogue, so PPO will refine style rather than basic syntax.

Spin up a reward head first. The `ieuniversity/flirty_or_not` dataset gives you labelled flirty‑versus‑neutral texts; fine‑tune a compact RoBERTa (or even a DistilBERT) on those 3 k lines with a simple classification head. Training is one epoch on a laptop; export the logits as your scalar reward. If you LoRA the classifier you’ll keep VRAM under 1 GB and the fine‑tune takes minutes. 

Drop that reward into TRL’s `PPOTrainer`. The trainer already fetches the base policy, runs rollouts, clips the KL, and logs `rlhf_reward` each batch. The quick‑start script in the docs shows the whole loop in about 40 lines, so your only edits are swapping in your reward function and bumping the batch size to taste.

I usually start with a prompt such as “Write an opening message to someone you have a crush on, make it playful but not cheesy” and let the agent explore. Within a few hundred updates you’ll see the reward curve rise and the sampled replies go from polite to cheeky. Keep the KL coefficient around 0.02 at first; if answers drift off‑topic, nudge it up, if the model stays stiff, loosen it. When the reward plateaus, save a checkpoint, crank up your own evaluation prompts and see whether you blush.

Extra spice if you’re curious: periodically sample the raw reward‑model top‑k predictions to check for label leakage—sometimes the agent learns to parrot dataset phrases verbatim. A bit of entropy bonus or data augmentation (swap gender, location, emoji) fixes that.

Here’s a tight, runnable sketch you can paste straight into `flirty_ppo.py` and launch with `accelerate launch flirty_ppo.py`. Everything is vanilla PyTorch + Transformers + TRL, so one GPU and about 8 GB VRAM will do.

```python

    return tok_rm(batch["text"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=64)
rm_ds = ds["train"].map(tokenize, batched=True).with_format("torch")

rm_base = get_peft_model(rm_base, LoraConfig(r=8, alpha=16, target_modules=["query","value"]))
rm_base.train()
opt = torch.optim.AdamW(rm_base.parameters(), lr=2e-5)

for epoch in range(1):                                     # one quick epoch
    for batch in torch.utils.data.DataLoader(rm_ds, batch_size=16, shuffle=True):
        out = rm_base(**{k: batch[k] for k in ["input_ids","attention_mask"]})
        loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(out.logits, batch["label"])
        loss.backward(); opt.step(); opt.zero_grad()

def reward_fn(samples):                                    # samples: list[str]
    with torch.no_grad():
        toks = tok_rm(samples, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True).to(rm_base.device)
        logits = rm_base(**toks).logits
        # take positive‑class logit as scalar reward
        return logits[:,1] - logits[:,0]

# ---------- 2. build the PPO agent ----------
policy_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
tok_pol = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(policy_name)
pol = AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead.from_pretrained(policy_name, low_cpu_mem_usage=True).half().cuda()

ppo_cfg = PPOConfig(
    batch_size=64,
    ppo_epochs=4,
    learning_rate=5e-6,
    target_kl=0.1,
    log_with="tensorboard"
)
ppo_trainer = PPOTrainer(config=ppo_cfg, model=pol, tokenizer=tok_pol, ref_model=None)

# ---------- 3. rollouts ----------
prompts = [
    "Write a playful but not cheesy opening line to someone you just matched with.",
    "Send a flirty yet respectful good‑morning message:"
]

for step in range(500):                                   # ~30 min on an RTX 4090
    batch_prompts = random.choices(prompts, k=ppo_cfg.batch_size)
    tokens = tok_pol(batch_prompts, return_tensors="pt", padding=True).to(pol.device)
    gen_kwargs = dict(max_new_tokens=60, do_sample=True, top_k=50, temperature=0.9)
    responses = ppo_trainer.generate(**tokens, **gen_kwargs)
    decoded = tok_pol.batch_decode(responses, skip_special_tokens=True)
    rewards  = reward_fn(decoded)
    ppo_trainer.step(batch_prompts, decoded, rewards)

pol.save_pretrained("flirty‑llama‑ppo")
tok_pol.save_pretrained("flirty‑llama‑ppo")
```

Fire it up, point a chat UI at `flirty‑llama‑ppo`, and after a few hundred updates you’ll see the model graduate from “Hi!” to something like “Morning, stranger—has anyone told you the sun’s jealous of that smile?” without tripping your cringe alarm.

If you want to monitor charm in real time, run `tensorboard --logdir runs` and watch `train/ppo/rlhf_reward` climb while `train/approx_kl` hovers near 0.1.

Have fun watching your Llama learn to wink, and ping me when it pulls off the perfect opener 😉
