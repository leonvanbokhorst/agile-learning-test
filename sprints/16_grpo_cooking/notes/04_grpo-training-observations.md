# Early Stage Key Metrics & Observations:

*   **`loss`:** The loss values are consistently small and negative (e.g., -0.0019, -0.0007, -0.0013). In GRPO (and similar RL methods like PPO/DPO), the loss itself isn't always directly interpretable like a standard cross-entropy loss. Negative loss is expected because the objective includes maximizing rewards (which often involves minimizing a negative term) and minimizing KL divergence. The fact that it's fluctuating around small negative values suggests the optimization process is active, but doesn't necessarily indicate "good" or "bad" on its own at this stage.
*   **`grad_norm`:** The gradient norms are stable and relatively low (around 0.18-0.20). This is generally a good sign, indicating that the updates aren't causing exploding gradients. The PEFT/LoRA setup likely helps keep gradients manageable.
*   **`learning_rate`:** It's decreasing slowly from the initial 1e-5, following the default linear scheduler. This is expected behavior.
*   **`rewards/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` (and `reward`):** This is the average score assigned by our trained reward model to the completions generated by the policy model in each batch. It's fluctuating (0.15, 0.26, 0.11, 0.27, etc.). This fluctuation is normal in RLHF as the policy model explores different generation strategies. Ideally, we'd want to see this trend *upwards* over the entire epoch, indicating the policy is learning to generate responses that the reward model prefers (which *should* correlate with better CoT reasoning). It's too early to tell the overall trend.
*   **`reward_std`:** The standard deviation of the rewards within each batch is quite high (~1.7-1.9). This means there's significant variance in how the reward model scores the different completions generated for the prompts within a batch. This variance is actually *good* for GRPO, as it relies on these relative differences (`A_i = (r_i - mean(r)) / std(r)`) to calculate the advantage signal.
*   **`kl`:** The KL divergence between the policy model and the reference model is very small (around 0.0005). This indicates that the policy model is staying very close to the original base model, heavily constrained by the `beta=0.1` term. This is often desired initially to prevent the model from "forgetting" its general capabilities, but a slightly higher KL might be needed later if the rewards don't improve significantly.
*   **`clip_ratio`:** This is 0.0, meaning the policy updates aren't being clipped yet. This suggests the updates are relatively small and within the trust region defined by the epsilon parameter in the GRPO loss calculation, which aligns with the low KL divergence.

**Overall Analysis (Early Stage):**

The training seems stable so far. Gradients are well-behaved, the learning rate is decaying as expected, and the reward model is showing variance in its scoring, which is necessary for the GRPO advantage calculation. The policy model is currently staying very close to the base model (low KL). The key metric to watch over the full epoch will be the **`reward`** â€“ we hope to see it trend upwards, indicating the model is successfully learning to generate the preferred (CoT) responses.
