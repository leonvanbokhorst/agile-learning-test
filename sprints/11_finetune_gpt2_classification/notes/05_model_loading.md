# Sprint 11 - Task 3: Model Modification Notes

## Objective

Load a pre-trained GPT-2 model suitable for sequence classification, ensuring it has a classification head appropriate for our binary task (Fake/Real).

## Process

1.  **Script Used:** `sprints/11_finetune_gpt2_classification/results/05_load_model.py`
2.  **Model Class:** Used `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` from `transformers`.
3.  **Configuration:**
    - Specified the base model checkpoint as `"gpt2"`.
    - Explicitly set `num_labels=2` in the model configuration (`AutoConfig`) before loading the model.
4.  **Loading:** Called `AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(MODEL_CHECKPOINT, config=config)`.
5.  **Verification:** Printed the loaded `model` object structure.

## Results

- The script successfully loaded the model.
- The output confirmed the base `GPT2Model` (transformer) structure with its 12 blocks.
- Crucially, a **new classification head layer was added on top of the base GPT-2 model**, rather than replacing its original output layer:
  - `(score): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=2, bias=False)`
  - This **additional** layer takes the final hidden states (768 dimensions) from the base model and outputs 2 logits, corresponding to our Fake/Real classes.
- Received a warning that the weights for **this new `score` layer** were newly initialized and that the model requires training.

## Conclusion

Task 3 is complete. We have successfully loaded the pre-trained GPT-2 model and adapted it for our specific sequence classification task by **adding** the appropriate classification head.

## Next Steps

Proceed to Task 4: Implement the fine-tuning loop.
