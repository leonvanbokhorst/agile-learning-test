# Sprint 11 - Task 4: Fine-Tuning Loop Implementation & Run 1

## Objective

Implement and execute a basic fine-tuning loop for the `GPT2ForSequenceClassification` model on the prepared fake news dataset, including periodic validation.

## Process

1.  **Script Used:** `sprints/11_finetune_gpt2_classification/results/06_finetune_loop.py`
2.  **Core Components:**
    - Loaded the tokenized/split dataset saved in `tokenized_data_split`.
    - Created `DataLoader`s for train and validation sets.
    - Loaded the pre-trained `GPT2ForSequenceClassification` model with `num_labels=2`.
    - Used the `AdamW` optimizer.
    - Implemented a standard PyTorch training loop (`model.train()`, forward pass, loss calculation, `loss.backward()`, `optimizer.step()`).
    - Implemented periodic validation within the epoch.
3.  **Periodic Validation Implementation:**
    - Extracted validation logic into a separate function `evaluate_model`.
    - Added a `global_step` counter.
    - Configured the loop to run `evaluate_model` every `EVAL_STEPS` (set to 250 by user modification).
    - Ensured the model mode was toggled correctly (`eval()` for validation, `train()` afterwards).
    - Included a final validation run at the end of each epoch.
4.  **Execution Parameters (Run 1):**
    - `MODEL_CHECKPOINT`: `gpt2`
    - `BATCH_SIZE`: 4 (User modified from 8)
    - `NUM_EPOCHS`: 1
    - `LEARNING_RATE`: `5e-5`
    - `EVAL_STEPS`: 250 (User modified from 500)
    - Device: MPS (Detected via `get_device()`)

## Results (Run 1 - 1 Epoch)

- **Training:**
  - Completed 6000 steps.
  - Average Training Loss (Epoch 1): `0.0239`
- **Validation:**
  - Evaluations performed every 250 steps.
  - Intermediate accuracies were generally very high (>99%), with some fluctuations observed (e.g., ~95% at step 2250, 100% at steps 5500/5750).
  - Final Validation Loss (Epoch 1): `0.0033`
  - Final Validation Accuracy (Epoch 1): `0.9990`
- **Time:** ~59 minutes.
- **Model Saving:** User prompted whether to save the model (assuming 'n' for now unless specified otherwise).

## Observations

- The model learned extremely quickly on this dataset, achieving near-perfect validation accuracy within a single epoch.
- The periodic validation showed some minor fluctuations but confirmed rapid convergence to high accuracy.
- The result might suggest the dataset/task is relatively separable for the model, or potentially warrants checking for data leakage (though splitting/stratification were used).

## Conclusion

Task 4 is complete. The fine-tuning loop was successfully implemented and executed, demonstrating the model's ability to learn the classification task effectively.

## Next Steps

Proceed to Task 5: Evaluation (using the test set).
