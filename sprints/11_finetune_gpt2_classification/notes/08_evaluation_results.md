# Sprint 11 - Task 5: Evaluation Results

## Objective

Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned GPT-2 model on the held-out test set to get an unbiased assessment of its generalization ability.

## Process

1.  **Script Used:** `sprints/11_finetune_gpt2_classification/results/07_evaluate_model.py`
2.  **Model Loading:** Loaded the fine-tuned model saved in the `finetuned_model` directory.
3.  **Data Loading:** Loaded the `test` split from the saved dataset in `tokenized_data_split` and created a `DataLoader`.
4.  **Evaluation:**
    - Set the model to `eval()` mode.
    - Iterated through the `test_dataloader` with `torch.no_grad()`.
    - Collected model predictions (argmax of logits) and true labels for all test examples.
5.  **Metrics Calculation:**
    - Used `sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score` to calculate overall accuracy.
    - Used `sklearn.metrics.classification_report` to generate precision, recall, and F1-score for each class ("Fake", "Real").

## Results

- **Test Accuracy:** **`0.9983`** (99.83%)
- **Classification Report:**

  ```

      accuracy                           1.00      3000
     macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00      3000
  weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00      3000
  ```

- **Time:** ~64 seconds on MPS.

## Conclusion

The fine-tuned model achieved outstanding performance on the unseen test data, confirming the high validation accuracy observed during training. The model generalizes extremely well to this specific fake news classification task after only one epoch of fine-tuning.

Task 5 is complete.

## Next Steps

- Update Sprint README with task completion and links.
- Update overall progress tracking (skills, milestones) if applicable.
- Consider next steps based on backlog (e.g., Sprint 12: Fine-tuning for Generation).
