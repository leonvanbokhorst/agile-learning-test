# GPT-2 Training Stats

Here's the lowdown on the GPT-2 small model (117M/124M parameters, the exact number varies slightly depending on the source/implementation, often rounded to 128M for simplicity):

*   **Parameters:** ~117 million to 124 million (often referred to as the 128M model class).
*   **Architecture:** It's a Transformer-based model with 12 layers (`n_layer = 12`), an embedding size of 768 (`n_embd = 768`), and 12 attention heads (`n_head = 12`).
*   **Training Data:** Originally trained by OpenAI on a dataset called WebText, which contained text scraped from 8 million web pages, totaling about 40 GB of text data.
*   **Training Objective:** It was trained using a simple causal language modeling (CLM) objective: predict the next word given all the previous words in a text.
*   **Compute/Time:** Precise public training time/cost figures specifically for the *small* model released by OpenAI aren't readily available in the search results. However, training these models, even the small ones, required significant computational resources (many GPU hours/days) and large datasets. Benchmarks on modern hardware (like A100s or T4s) show that even fine-tuning or inference with these models requires substantial VRAM and processing time, especially without quantization. For example, one benchmark showed inference on a 7B parameter model (much larger than GPT-2 small, but gives context) taking ~25 seconds per item on an A100 GPU in 16-bit precision.


# Training a GPT-2 small model from scratch on consumer hardware

Let's break down the feasibility of training a GPT-2 small model (the ~124M parameter one) from scratch on consumer hardware.

**The Short Answer:**

Technically *possible*? Yes. Practically *feasible* for achieving a model comparable to OpenAI's original? Hooo boy, that's a stretch. It's like deciding to build a skyscraper with a really nice hammer â€“ you *can* hit things with it, but the scale is a bit off.

**The Long Answer (with more hammering):**

1.  **VRAM (The Good News):**
    *   An RTX 4090 boasts a glorious 24 GB of VRAM.
    *   The GPT-2 small model itself isn't huge (around 0.5 GB in FP32, 0.25 GB in FP16/BF16).
    *   Even with gradients, optimizer states (especially if using 8-bit Adam or similar), and activations for a reasonable batch size (say, 4-16) and sequence length (1024), you *should* be able to fit the training process into 24 GB, especially using mixed precision (BF16 is well-supported on the 4090 and generally preferred).
    *   **Verdict:** VRAM-wise, you're likely okay. The 4090 has enough space for this particular model size with common optimizations.

2.  **Compute Time (The "Oh Dear" News):**
    *   Training *from scratch* means showing the model *billions* of tokens. OpenAI used ~40 GB of text (WebText). Datasets like The Pile or C4 are even larger.
    *   A 4090 is a beast for a consumer card, no doubt. But pre-training large language models, even "small" ones by today's standards, is usually done on large clusters of datacenter GPUs (like A100s or H100s) running for days or weeks.
    *   Let's do some *very* rough back-of-the-napkin math: Assume you process a few thousand tokens per second (highly dependent on batch size, sequence length, software stack). Training on, say, 10 billion tokens could take `10,000,000,000 tokens / (let's guess 5000 tokens/sec) = 2,000,000 seconds` which is roughly **23 days** of *non-stop* 100% GPU utilization... for **one epoch**. You'll likely need multiple epochs.
    *   **Verdict:** Training from scratch on a dataset large enough to produce a generally capable model will take an *agonizingly* long time on a single 4090. Weeks, potentially months. Your electricity bill will weep.

3.  **Data:**
    *   You need a massive, high-quality dataset (like OpenWebText, a subset of The Pile, or C4) and the infrastructure to preprocess and feed it efficiently. This isn't trivial.

**Conclusion:**

*   **Fine-tuning** an existing pre-trained GPT-2 small model on a specific task? Absolutely! A 4090 is excellent for that and can do it relatively quickly (hours to days, depending on the task and data).
*   **Pre-training** GPT-2 small *from scratch*? While the 24 GB VRAM makes it *technically possible* to fit the model and training state, the sheer amount of compute required to process the necessary billions of tokens makes it practically infeasible for most individuals. You'd be running that 4090 ragged for weeks or months to get a potentially mediocre result compared to models trained on proper infrastructure.
