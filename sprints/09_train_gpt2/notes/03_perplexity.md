# Perplexity Implementation Notes

## Overview

We implemented perplexity calculation as our primary evaluation metric for the language model, providing a measure of how well the model predicts the next token in a sequence.

## Key Components

### Perplexity Calculation

- Defined as exp(average loss)
- Calculated on validation set
- Proper handling of padding tokens
- Efficient computation

### Evaluation Loop

- Uses `torch.no_grad()` for efficiency
- Proper model state management (eval/train)
- Batch-wise computation
- Memory-efficient implementation

## Implementation Decisions

### Loss Averaging

- Average loss per token
- Proper weighting of sequence lengths
- Handling of padding tokens

### Validation Strategy

- Regular evaluation intervals
- Full validation set evaluation
- Proper batching for efficiency

### Memory Management

- No gradient computation during evaluation
- Efficient tensor operations
- Proper cleanup of intermediate results

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Numerical Stability**

   - Problem: Potential overflow in exp calculation
   - Solution: Added overflow handling and proper loss scaling

2. **Padding Tokens**

   - Problem: Need to exclude padding tokens from calculation
   - Solution: Implemented proper masking and averaging

3. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Problem: Large validation sets could exceed memory
   - Solution: Implemented batch-wise evaluation

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Metrics**

   - Add BLEU score calculation
   - Implement ROUGE metrics
   - Add custom evaluation metrics

2. **Evaluation Strategies**

   - Add support for different evaluation sets
   - Implement cross-validation
   - Add support for different sequence lengths

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching for evaluation results
   - Implement parallel evaluation
   - Add support for distributed evaluation
