# Training from Scratch

Training models, especially Transformers like GPT, from scratch *can* indeed take a significant amount of time. It's not like the instant gratification of fine-tuning an existing behemoth!

Here's the lowdown on what influences training time, specifically for our little project here:

1.  **Model Size:** Our GPT model, while not huge by today's standards (think GPT-3/4 with billions/trillions of parameters!), still has around 124 million parameters (based on the logs). That's a lot of numbers to crunch in each step! More parameters = more math = more time.
2.  **Dataset Size:** We're using TinyShakespeare, which is... well, *tiny* (~1MB). This is great for learning because epochs won't take *forever*. If we were training on Wikipedia or a massive web crawl (gigabytes or terabytes), each epoch would take vastly longer.
3.  **Hardware (The Big Kahuna):** This is probably the *most* significant factor.
    *   **CPU:** Training this on a CPU would be like trying to fill a swimming pool with an eyedropper. Painfully slow. Don't do it. Seriously.
    *   **GPU:** GPUs are designed for the kind of parallel matrix math needed here. They speed things up massively.
    *   **Your GPU (MPS):** The logs show you're using Apple Silicon's MPS backend. This is WAY faster than a CPU! However, compared to high-end NVIDIA GPUs (which most heavy-duty ML research uses), MPS performance for training large models like this can still be considerably slower. It's fantastic for running *pre-trained* models or smaller training tasks, but for from-scratch training of a 100M+ parameter model, expect it to take longer than it would on, say, an NVIDIA A100 or even a good RTX card.
4.  **Batch Size & Sequence Length:** Larger batches and longer sequences mean more data is processed per iteration. This can sometimes lead to faster convergence *in terms of epochs*, but each *iteration* takes longer and requires more GPU memory. Our test run used small values (`batch=4`, `seq=64`), which is faster per iteration but less efficient overall. Real training would likely use larger values.

**So, what to expect for *our* training run?**

*   **Not Instant:** Don't expect results in 5 minutes.
*   **Epoch Time:** Even on TinyShakespeare, with 124M parameters running on MPS, each epoch could take anywhere from several minutes to maybe even an hour or more, depending heavily on your specific Mac chip and the final batch size/sequence length we use. The test run logs showed individual iterations taking milliseconds, but there are *many* iterations per epoch (75k in the test config!).
*   **Total Time:** To get the model to actually learn something meaningful (i.e., generate somewhat coherent text, see the validation loss drop significantly), you'll likely need to run it for multiple epochs. This could easily stretch into **several hours or potentially even a day or more** on MPS hardware.
*   **The Goal:** Remember, the primary goal here is understanding the *process* of building and training the model. We're not aiming to create the next state-of-the-art Shakespeare generator on this dataset/hardware combo in a short time.

**In short:** Grab a coffee (or several ☕). Training from scratch is a marathon, not a sprint, especially without top-tier GPU resources. Monitor the loss in TensorBoard, be patient, and celebrate the small victories as the loss starts to go down!

# Using the RTX 4090

Using your RTX 4090 will make a **massive** difference compared to the Mac's MPS. That card is a beast specifically designed for this kind of heavy lifting (CUDA!). Training time will likely drop dramatically – from potentially days/many hours down to just hours, or maybe even less depending on how many epochs we run and the batch size/sequence length we use.

Here's how you'd typically switch over:

1.  **Environment:** Make sure the Python environment you're using (managed by `uv` in this case) has the **CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch** installed. When you install PyTorch, it usually comes in CPU, CUDA, or ROCm variants. If you installed on your Mac, you might only have the CPU/MPS version. You'd need to install the CUDA version on the machine with the 4090. The official PyTorch website has instructions for installing with CUDA support (it usually involves specifying the CUDA version, like `pytorch-cuda=12.1`).
2.  **CUDA Drivers & Toolkit:** Ensure the machine with the 4090 has the appropriate NVIDIA drivers and CUDA Toolkit installed system-wide. PyTorch relies on these.
3.  **Code:** Our `train_gpt2.py` script is already prepared!
    *   The `get_device()` function automatically prioritizes CUDA (`torch.cuda.is_available()`) over MPS. So, if the correct PyTorch and CUDA drivers are installed, it *should* pick the 4090 automatically.
    *   Alternatively, you can explicitly tell it to use CUDA by running the script with the `--device cuda` argument:
        ```bash
        python sprints/09_train_gpt2/results/train_gpt2.py --device cuda --num_epochs 5 --batch_size 32 --seq_length 256 # Example with CUDA and larger settings
        ```
4.  **Memory:** The 4090 has plenty of VRAM (24GB), so you should be able to use much larger batch sizes (`--batch_size`) and sequence lengths (`--seq_length`) compared to our test run, which will speed up training convergence significantly.

**In short:** Switching to the 4090 is highly recommended if you want to train the model reasonably quickly and see meaningful results from the "from scratch" process.
