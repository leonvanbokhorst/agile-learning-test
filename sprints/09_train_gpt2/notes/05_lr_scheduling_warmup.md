# Learning Rate Scheduling Implementation Notes

## Overview

We implemented a sophisticated learning rate scheduling system with warmup and cosine decay, optimizing the training process for transformer models.

## Key Components

### Learning Rate Schedule

- Linear warmup phase
- Cosine decay phase
- Minimum learning rate
- Configurable parameters

### Schedule Parameters

- Warmup iterations: 100
- Maximum learning rate: 6e-4
- Minimum learning rate: 6e-5
- Decay iterations: configurable

## Implementation Decisions

### Warmup Phase

- Linear increase from 0 to max_lr
- Prevents early training instability
- Configurable duration
- Smooth transition to decay

### Decay Phase

- Cosine decay schedule
- Smooth learning rate reduction
- Configurable minimum learning rate
- Proper handling of edge cases

### Integration

- Proper optimizer integration
- Checkpoint compatibility
- Efficient computation
- Memory-efficient implementation
