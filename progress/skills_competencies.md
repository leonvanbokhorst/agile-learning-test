# Skills & Competencies Log

## Baseline Assessment (Start of Project)

- **General Programming (Python):** Proficient (Assumed based on user input)
  - _Note: Demonstrated understanding of modern Python packaging (`pyproject.toml`, `src`-layout)._
- **Deep Learning Concepts:** Familiar with Practical Applications (User reports experience with training, fine-tuning (LoRA), and quantization (gguf) of DL models, especially LLMs)
  - _Goal: Deepen foundational understanding required for building models from scratch._
- **PyTorch Framework:** Familiar (User reports experience with training/fine-tuning existing models)
  - _Goal: Gain proficiency in *implementing* core components (Tensors, Autograd, nn.Module internals, DataLoader customization) from scratch, not just using high-level APIs._
- **Transformer Architecture:** Novice (Conceptual understanding likely present, but practical implementation from scratch is the goal)
  - _Goal: Understand and implement key components (Attention, Positional Encoding, etc.) in PyTorch._
- **LLM (GPT-like) Implementation:** Novice (in terms of building from scratch)
  - _User has conceptual knowledge and practical experience fine-tuning, quantizing, and deploying LLMs._
  - _Goal: Build a functional model from foundational PyTorch components._
- **Hugging Face Ecosystem:** Familiar / Proficient (User reports using it for datasets and models)
- **Virtual Environments (venv/conda):** Proficient (User reports daily usage)
  - _Note: Successfully used `uv` for environment creation and package installation._
- **Git / Version Control (Git/GitHub):** Proficient (User reports essential daily usage)

## Sprint 1 Progress (Setup & Basics)

- **Environment Setup:** Completed.
  - Configured `pyproject.toml` for project dependencies and metadata.
  - Utilized `uv` to install dependencies (including `torch` and dev tools) into the virtual environment.
  - Implemented standard `src`-layout to resolve packaging ambiguity.

_(Update this section as sprints are completed or significant learning occurs. Add specific skills or concepts learned under relevant headings.)_
